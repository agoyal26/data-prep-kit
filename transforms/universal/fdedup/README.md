## Description
The fdedup transform eliminates documents that are highly similar to each other (but not necessarily identical) from a
set of Parquet files. This ensures that the resulting dataset contains only unique or sufficiently distinct entries.

Fuzzy dedup is a complex process made up of a pipeline that performs four main steps:

1. **Signature Calculation**: creates a set of minhashes for each document, and uses them to create band signatures for
the document.
2. **Cluster Analysis**: groups documents into clusters based on matching band signatures. Within each cluster, it
retains only the documents that have a Jaccard similarity above a specified threshold, and it identifies which documents
to keep as unique and which ones to mark as duplicates.
3. **Duplicate List Generation**: combines the similarity clusters identified in each band to create a single, unified
list of duplicate documents.
4. **Data Cleaning**: processes the documents by either filtering out duplicates or adding annotations to distinguish
duplicates from non-duplicates.

Each one of these steps is described in more detail below.

### Signature Calculation

This transform computes `num_permutations` minhashes and `num_bands` signatures for each document in the dataset, by
following these processing steps:
1. **Shingle Generation**: create a set of character or word shingles, using a specified window length. Character
shingles are more effective at detecting similar documents, but require more computational resources compared to word
shingles.
2. **Minhash Calculation**: using the shingles as input, compute `num_permutations` minhashes for each document.
3. **Band Signature Calculation**: divide the minhashes into `num_bands`, where each band contains
`num_minhashes_per_band` minhashes. For each document, generate a unique signature for every band.

The values for `num_bands` and `num_minhashes_per_band` determine the likelihood that documents with a certain Jaccard
similarity will be marked as duplicates. A Jupyter notebook in the [utils](utils/calc_r_and_b.ipynb) folder generates a graph of this
probability function, helping users explore how different settings for `num_bands` and `num_minhashes_per_band` impact
the deduplication process.

To help distribute the workload and speed up processing of the next steps, the hash space of each band is divided into
`num_segments` segments. The band signatures, the minhashes, the document ids, and lengths are stored in an organized
output folder structure `bands/band=b/segment=s`, where `b` is the band number and `s` is the segment number.

### Cluster Analysis

This transform leverages segmented processing to analyze the data generated by the **Signature Calculation** step
efficiently and in parallel. Each worker processes a specific segment `s` of a band `b` by loading and analyzing all
Parquet files from the folder `bands/band=b/segment=s`. Each row in the Parquet files contains, for a document:
* `band_hash`, the document's band signature, and 
* `data`, a structure with three fields: the unique `document_id`, document's `minhashes`, and `document_size`.

The transform runs the following processing steps:
1. **Data Loading**: combine into a single dataframe all Parquet files in `bands/band=b/segment=s`.
2. **Clustering**: run a `group_by` operation on the `band_hash` column that will group documents with the same band
signature into clusters.
3. **Similarity Analysis**: for each cluster, calculate Jaccard similarity between pairs of documents using their
minhashes, and move documents below the specified Jaccard similarity threshold into new clusters.
4. **Duplicate Identification**: in clusters with more than one document remaining, retain the largest document with the
smallest document id, and mark as duplicates all other documents in the cluster.
5. **Persist Results**: save the duplicate clusters in a file.

### Duplicate List Generation

The **Cluster Analysis** step identifies duplicates across multiple bands, meaning a document can be marked as a
duplicate in one or more bands (e.g., if two documents are identical, one will be marked as a duplicate in all bands).
This transform consolidates all duplicate information from each band segment into a single file, providing a unified
record of duplicates detected across the dataset.

### Data Cleaning

This transform processes the original dataset using the list of duplicate documents generated by the **Duplicate List
Generation** step. It imports each file in the original dataset into a table and produces a new dataset. The directory
structure of the input dataset is preserved, but the contents of the output files depend on the selected operating mode:
1. **Annotate** - add a new `duplicate` column to the dataset, that contains a `d` for documents marked as duplicates,
and is empty for non-duplicates
2. **Filter duplicates** - removes all documents identified as duplicates from the dataset.
3. **Filter non-duplicates** - removes from the dataset all documents that were not marked as duplicates, leaving only
the duplicates.

The output dataset reflects the selected mode, providing flexibility for downstream processing.
