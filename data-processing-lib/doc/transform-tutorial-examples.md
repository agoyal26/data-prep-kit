# Tutorial Example
We use a tutorial to show how to develop a new transform.
Before getting started, you may want to consult the 
[transform project root readme](../../transforms/README.md) documentation.

* [Tutorial](../../doc/quick-start/contribute-your-own-transform.md) - 
Here we will take a simple example to show the basics of creating a simple transform
that takes a single input Table, and produces a single Table.
* [External resources transform](transform-external-resources.md) - shows how to load additional
resources (models, configuration, etc) for a transform.
